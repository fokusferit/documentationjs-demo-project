# DEMO Project for DocumentationJS

This demo repository was created to showcase how developers would use DocumentationJS and JSDocs to document and generate Markdown API documentation out of that.


## How to start

This demo uses [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli) to generate an initial project. 

This means you have to do an initial `npm install` and if you've never used npm before, you need to download [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)

You can either run the project via `npm run dev`.

## How to generate documentation

If you're interested in playing around with documentationJS you can run `npm run docs` to generate a new version of your docs. Currently it is just generating the docs for one file (a more complex example is in progress).
